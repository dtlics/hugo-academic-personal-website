abstract: The existence of incompatible observables is a cornerstone of quantum
  mechanics and a valuable resource in quantum technologies. Here we introduce a
  measure of incompatibility, called the mutual eigenspace disturbance (MED),
  which quantifies the amount of disturbance induced by the measurement of a
  sharp observable on the eigenspaces of another. The MED is a faithful measure
  of incompatibility for sharp observables and provides a metric on the space of
  von Neumann measurements. It can be efficiently estimated by letting the
  measurements act in an indefinite order, using a setup known as the quantum
  switch. Thanks to these features, the MED can be used in quantum machine
  learning tasks, such as clustering quantum measurement devices based on their
  mutual compatibility. We demonstrate this application by providing an
  unsupervised algorithm that clusters unknown von Neumann measurements. Our
  algorithm is robust to noise can be used to identify groups of observers that
  share approximately the same measurement context.

summary: We defined a new quantity to describe the incompatibility between
